abstract = {The benefits of international diversification have been recognized for decades. In spite of this, most investors hold nearly all of their wealth in domestic assets. In this paper, we construct new estimates of the international equity portfolio holdings of investors in the U.S., Japan, and Britain. More than 98\% of the equity portfolio of Japanese investors is held domestically; the analogous percentages are 94\% for the U.S., and 82\% for Britain. We use a simple model of investor preferences and behavior to show that current portfolio patterns imply that investors in each nation expect returns in their domestic equity market to be several hundred basis points higher than returns in other markets. This lack of diversification appears to be the result of investor choices, rather than institutional constraints. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {We study the immediate and delayed market reaction to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR 10-K filings. Unusual trading volumes and stock-price movements are documented during the days around the 10-K filing dates. The abnormal price movements are positively associated with future accounting profitability, indicating that 10-K reports contain useful information about future firm performance. In addition, investors' reaction to 10-K information seems sluggish, as demonstrated by the stock-price drift during the 12-month period after 10-K filing. We find that investors' underreaction tends to be stronger for firms with more complex 10-K reports.

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the investment patterns of a large number of clients of a major Israeli brokerage house during 1994. We compare the behavior of clients making independent investment decisions to that of investors whose accounts were managed by brokerage professionals. Our main objective is to investigate whether the disposition effect (i.e., the tendency to sell winners quicker than losers), demonstrated in the US only for individual investors, also holds for professional investors. This analysis is important, as accepted financial theory predicts that prices are determined mainly by decisions made by professionals. We show that both professional and independent investors exhibit the disposition effect, although the effect is stronger for independent investors. The second objective of our study is the comparison of trade frequency, volume and profitability between independent and professionally managed accounts. We believe that these comparisons not only provide insights of their own, but also help to put the differences in the disposition effect in a wider perspective. We demonstrate that professionally managed accounts were more diversified and that round trips were both less correlated with the market and slightly more profitable than those of independent accounts. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the design and statistical properties of event study methods. Event studies examine the behavior of firms' stock prices around corporate events. A vast literature on event studies written over the past several decades has become an important part of financial economics. Prior to that time, "there was little evidence on the central issues of corporate finance. The number of published event studies exceeds 500, and the literature continues to grow. This chapter provides an overview of event study methods. Short-horizon methods are quite reliable. While long-horizon methods have improved, serious limitations remain. A challenge is to continue to refine long-horizon methods. This chapter also presents new evidence illustrating that properties of event study methods can vary by calendar time period and can depend on event sample firm characteristics such as volatility. This reinforces the importance of using stratified samples to examine event study statistical properties. This chapter highlights key econometric issues in event study methods, and summarizes what is known about the statistical design and the interpretation of event study experiments. Based on the theoretical and empirical findings of the methodology literature, it provides clear guidelines both for producers and consumers of event studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hedge fund activism has increased almost hyperbolically. Some view this optimistically as a means for bridging the separation of ownership and control; others are more pessimistic, seeing mainly wealth transfers from bondholders or speculative expectations of a takeover as fueling the spike. Equivalent division exists over the impact of this increased activism, with optimists seeing real gains that do not erode over time and improvements in operating performance, and pessimists predicting shortened investment horizons, increased leverage, and reduced investment in research and development. Our perspective is analytic. We begin by surveying the regulatory and institutional developments that have reduced the costs and increased the expected payoff from activism for hedge funds. Here, we focus particularly on the formation of “wolf packs”—namely, loose knit associations of hedge funds that are formed prior to, or contemporaneously with, the filing of a Schedule 13D. We then look at other new institutional structures that are appearing, as typified by the alliance between Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant Pharmaceuticals in their bid for Allergan. Then, we survey the empirical evidence on the impact of activism, looking successively at (1) who are the targets of activism?; (2) does hedge fund activism create real value?; (3) what are the sources of gains from activism?; and (4) do the targets of activism experience post-intervention changes in real variables? Although confident claims have been made by some researchers, we find the evidence decidedly mixed on most questions (other than the short term stock price impact). In particular, we find the conclusions about improvements in target operating performance that have been expressed by some to be overextended beyond their actual data and premature. Finally, we examine the policy levers that could encourage or chill hedge fund activism and consider the feasibility of reforms. The gains from hedge fund activism may be high both because such activity is relatively low risk (if asymmetric information can be exploited that is acquired before the filing of a Schedule 13D) and short-term (with the median hedge fund activist holding for approximately nine months). Still, we predict that the impact of most regulatory changes are likely to be marginal. Conversely, we believe that private ordering (through techniques such as a “window-closing” poison pill) could achieve at least as much as regulatory changes},

abstract = {This paper examines whether a simple accounting-based fundamental analysis strategy, when applied to a broad portfolio of high book-to-market firms, can shift the distribution of returns earned by an investor. I show that the mean return earned by a high book-to-market investor can be increased by at least 7.5\% annually through the selection of financially strong high BM firms, while the entire distribution of realized returns is shifted to the right. In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a 23\% annual return between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies. Within the portfolio of high BM firms, the benefits to financial statement analysis are concentrated in small and medium-sized firms, companies with low share turnover, and firms with no analyst following, yet this superior performance is not dependent on purchasing firms with low share prices. A positive relationship between the sign of the initial historical information and both future firm performance and subsequent quarterly earnings announcement reactions suggests that the market initially underreacts to the historical information. In particular, one-sixth of the annual return difference between ex ante strong and weak firms is earned over the four three-day periods surrounding these quarterly earnings announcements. Overall, the evidence suggests that the market does not fully incorporate historical financial information into prices in a timely manner.},

abstract = {The acquisition of a partial stake in a target firm has been positively linked to the likelihood that the target will be involved in a follow on full acquisition involving either the original bidder or a third party bidder. Existing studies provide only suggestive evidence of this linkage by comparing the abnormal returns to partial targets that are ultimately acquired to those that are not. Using a sample of partial acquisitions, we identify characteristics that impact the probability of a full acquisition and provide a tangible link between partial target gains and the ex ante probability of acquisition. Partial targets experience positive announcement effects, and the gains are greater for subsequently acquired targets. Partial bids initiated by corporate bidders are more likely to result in a full acquisition, and the size of the acquired stake and the level of institutional ownership are positively linked to the probability of acquisition. Further, the partial target gains are positively linked to the ex ante probability of acquisition even after controlling for any increased monitoring and discipline that the partial bidder is expected to impose. The findings are robust across various time horizons and model specifications. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

We show that cash-based operating profitability (a measure that excludes accruals) outperforms measures of profitability that include accruals. Further, cash-based operating profitability subsumes accruals in predicting the cross section of average returns. An investor can increase a strategy's Sharpe ratio more by adding just a cash-based operating profitability factor to the investment opportunity set than by adding both an accruals factor and a profitability factor that includes accruals.},

We conclude that, when informed traders can select when and how to trade, standard measures of adverse selection may fail to capture the presence of informed trading.},

Alternatively, hos- tility could reflect strategic choices made by the bidder or the target. Empirical tests show that most deals described as hostile in the press are not distinguishable from friendly deals in economic terms, except that hostile transactions involve publicity as part of the bargaining process.},

abstract = {We describe the fundamental issues that long-horizon event studies face in choosing the proper research methodology, and summarize findings from existing simulation studies about the performance of commonly used methods. We document in details how to implement a simulation study and report findings from our own study that focuses on large-size samples. The findings have important implications for future research. In our simulation study, we examine the performance of more than twenty different testing procedures, which can be broadly classified into two categories: the buy-and-hold benchmark approach and the calendar-time portfolio approach. The first approach uses a benchmark to measure the abnormal buy-and-hold return for every event firm, and tests the null hypothesis that the average abnormal return is zero. We investigate the performance of five ways of choosing the benchmark and four test statistics including the standard t-test, the Johnson's skewness-adjusted t-test, the bootstrapped Johnson's skewness-adjusted t-test, and the Fisher's sign test. The second approach forms a portfolio in each calendar month consisting of firms that have had an event within a certain time period prior to the month, and tests the null hypothesis that the intercept is zero in the regression of monthly calendar-time portfolio returns against the factors in an asset-pricing model. We implement this approach with both the Fama-French three- factor model and the four-factor model with an additional momentum factor, and with both the ordinary least-squares and weighted least-squares estimation methods. We find that the combination of the sign test and the benchmark with a single most correlated firm provides the best overall performance for various sample sizes and long horizons. Furthermore, the Fama-French three-factor model is a better asset pricing model for monthly returns of calendar-time portfolios than the four-factor model, as the latter leads to serious overrejection of the null hypothesis.

We find that in addition to standard industry fixed effects, financial structure also depends on a firm`s position within its industry. In competitive industries, a firm`s financial leverage depends on its natural hedge (its proximity to the median industry capital-labor ratio), the actions of other firms in the industry, and its status as entrant, incumbent, or exiting firm. Financial leverage is higher and less dispersed in concentrated industries, where strategic debt interactions are also stronger, but a firm`s natural hedge is not significant. Our results show that financial structure, technology, and risk are jointly determined within industries.

We also show that PER, EBITDA and Profit after Tax (the most commonly used parameters for multiples) were more volatile than equity value during the period 1991-99. We also provide additional evidence of the analysts' recommendations for Spanish companies: less than 15\% of the recommendations are to sell. However, multiples are useful in a second stage of the valuation: after performing the valuation using another method, a comparison with the multiples of comparable firms enables us to gauge the valuation performed and identify differences between the firm valued and the firms it is compared with.},
